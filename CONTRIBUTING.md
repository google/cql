### Review our community guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

### Coding Guidelines

**Note**: Code may be automatically formatted per the guidelines when merged.

#### Go specific

All Go code should comply with the
[Go Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments) and
[Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) guides, as well as the
additional guidelines described here.

#### Early exit

All code, unless it substantially increases the line count or complexity, should
use early exits from loops and functions where possible.

### Bug IDs

Some `TODO`s and `NOTE`s sprinkled throughout the code have associated IDs of
the form `b/1234`. These correspond to bugs in our internal bug tracker.
Eventually these bugs will be moved to the GitHub Issues, but until then they
can simply be ignored.

## Contribution process

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, it may be beneficial to check out
[docs/implementation.md](docs/implementation.md). This document should give you
a basic understanding of the different structures that make up the engine, and
how language pieces are defined.

Another good reference is
[https://cql.hl7.org/09-b-cqlreference.html](https://cql.hl7.org/09-b-cqlreference.html)
for getting a good understanding of what behaviors a feature should implement.

### Implementing Your First Issue

A good place to start in the CQL engine repository is by implementing additional
system operators. Operators we do not yet support can be found in the
[exclusions list](tests/spectests/exclusions/exclusions.go) for the CQL
language specification tests. You may also want to check the repository issues
for any particular feature requests or bugs as well.

The [exclusions list](tests/spectests/exclusions/exclusions.go) contains
skip definitions by both test group and test name. Test names marked explicitly
with TODOs may be a great place to start.

### Implementing New Parser Functionality

For the feature that you have selected to work on, you will likely need to start
by implementing some logic to convert parsed ANTLR grammar into an internal
representation.

The [CQL ANTLR Grammar](internal/embeddata/third_party/cqframework/Cql.g4) represents the CQL syntax, which is used to compile CQL into [Go ANTLR nodes](internal/embeddata/third_party/cqframework/cql/).
The parser traverses these ANTLR nodes to build intermediate model structures
for the interpreter to process.

The engine model structures are based on the
[ELM definitions](https://cql.hl7.org/elm.html), and represent compiled CQL.
These models are defined in [model/model.go](model/model.go) while the parsings
of the models is done inside [parser/expressions.go](parser/expressions.go).

Most operators will also need a functional definition mapped to the model as
well, this is done inside [parser/operator.go](parser/operator.go).

### Implementing in the Interpreter

Inside the interpreter you will need to do two things, add a function that takes
in the model and any CQL operands, and map the model to that function in the
operator dispatcher.

For the model to interpreter logic mapping navigate to
[interpreter/operator_dispatcher.go](interpreter/operator_dispatcher.go).
From there you can declare a new interpreter logic function in the relevant
[interpreter/](interpreter/) file.

Please make sure to follow good code hygiene practices and write tests for any
code you write!

### Submitting
